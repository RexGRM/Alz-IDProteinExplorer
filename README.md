# IntrinsicProteinSim
# Protein Simulation and Visualization

This GitHub repository hosts a powerful simulation tool for intrinsic proteins, utilizing Monte Carlo methods to analyze and visualize protein characteristics such as charges, hydrophobicity, and disorderness. The software processes Protein Data Bank (PDB) files to output manipulated PDB files, detailed visualizations, and insightful graphs depicting key protein properties.

## Getting Started

This section provides detailed instructions on setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software and libraries are installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for generating graphs)
- Biopython (for handling PDB
